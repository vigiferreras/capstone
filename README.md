Hello! Thank you very much for checking out my project

The two main folders you should worry about are the docs and data folder. 

The docs folder contains my project's proposal. 

The data folder contains all of the good stuff. This contains my final code file which includes my raw code with lots of comments and explanations. Furthermore, the code file where I web scrapped data (Best New Artist Scrape.ipynb) is also in this folder. If you look in the Spotify data folder,  my ipynb files for my spotify API pulls are also there. 

All of the datasets used in this project can be found in the data folder as well. If you need more information regarding what is included in each dataset, please look at my proposal which discusses the datasets more in detail. 

Thank you very much again!
