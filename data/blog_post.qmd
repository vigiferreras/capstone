# Welcome

I am going to list five very different artists and I want you to try and figure out what these artists have in common: Evanescence, Cyndi Lauper, Victoria Monet, Carrie Underwood, and Arrested Development. This is a very challenging task but here is a hint: they have all won a similar music award. If your answer is that they all won a Grammy you are partially correct. These five artists are all recipients of the Grammy’s Best New Artist Award. 

Presented by the Recording Academy of the United States, the Grammy Awards show is one of the most prestigious award shows in the music industry. With over 90 awards recognizing the successes and talents of many individuals within the music industry, the Best New Artist award presented during the show draws a lot of allure due to the fact that it shines light towards talented new artists.

Aside from the excitement and allurement associated with this ceremony and the awards given out, there is a dark mystery that is tied to the Grammys: the Best New Artist Curse. The curse has been a subject of debate for years, stating that winners of this award are cursed with a short-lived career, marked by a decline in successes, achievements, and relevancy. As an avid music listener and fan myself, I have been intrigued by this curse and have always questioned its validity. Do the successes of artists truly decrease after winning this award? Is there a way to predict the success trajectory of future Best New Artist winners? 

To answer these questions I will be utilizing my data science knowledge and skills to analyze the post-award musical achievements of these artists and explore the potential for predicting an artist’s success. Without further-ado, follow me as I combine music and data to dissect the mysteries of the Best New Artist curse.

# Data Collection 

Every Data Science project needs its data, therefore I went ahead and collected as much data as I can find publicly to investigate this curse. I went through a meticulous data collection process utilizing various methods:

#### Manual Data Entry
Beginning with the focal point of the project, I used the Grammy’s official website to compile a list of Best New Artist winners spanning from 1985 to 2022. To assess post-award activity, I used the IMDb.com website to collect information about music award wins and nominations from the MTV Video Music Awards and the American Music Awards, as well as the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) website to gather data regarding gold, platinum, and diamond awards. For all of these manual collections, I entered the data into a separate spreadsheet for each unique award. 

I also manually collect details about the winners, including birth location, gender, and membership in music groups, primarily from Wikipedia.

#### Web Scraping: 
To further investigate post-award activity, I employed web-scraping techniques to collect Billboard Hot 100s data. Collecting this data will allow us to look for how many chart appearances these award recipients have had post-award win. 

#### Spotify API: 
Utilizing Spotify’s API, I collected data on the genres associated with each Best New Artist winner. 

These methods allowed me to collect a wide variety of data that can be used for future analysis. Please keep in mind that there are potential limitations that arise from this collected data, particularly in regards to the reliability of the data collected from public sources. 

# Patterns Among Best New Artist Winners

Before delving into the analysis of these winners' success, lets breifly examine the commonalities shared by these artists. Are there any noticable patterns among the features shared by Best New Artist winners?




```{python}

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg

# Load the image from the file
img = mpimg.imread('gender_distribution.png')

# Display the image
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis('off')  # Turn off axis labels
plt.show()
```

:::{.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.

For your reference, here's an example of a Python code cell in Quarto, along with a figure that gets generated, along with a caption and a label so that it can be referred to automatically as "Figure 1" (or whatever) in the writeup.

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Here's an example of citing a source [see @phil99, pp. 33-35]. Be sure the source information is entered in "BibTeX" form in the `references.bib` file.


The bibliography will automatically get generated. Any sources you cite in the document will be included. Other entries in the `.bib` file will not be included.
