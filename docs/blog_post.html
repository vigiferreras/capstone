<p>I am going to list five very different artists and I want you to try and figure out what these artists have in common: Evanescence, Cyndi Lauper, Victoria Monet, Carrie Underwood, and Arrested Development. This is a very challenging task but here is a hint: they have all won a similar music award. If your answer is that they all won a Grammy, you are partially correct. These five artists are all recipients of the Grammy’s Best New Artist Award.</p>
<p>Presented by the Recording Academy of the United States, the Grammy Awards show is one of the most prestigious award shows in the music industry. With over 90 awards recognizing the successes and talents of many individuals within the music industry, the Best New Artist award presented during the show draws a lot of attention due to the fact that it shines light towards talented new artists.</p>
<p>Aside from the excitement associated with this ceremony and the awards given out, there is a dark mystery that is tied to the Grammys: the Best New Artist Curse. The curse has been a subject of debate for years <span class="citation" data-cites="curse_article">(<a href="#ref-curse_article" role="doc-biblioref">Helligar, n.d.</a>)</span>, stating that winners of this award are cursed with a short-lived career, marked by a decline in successes, achievements, and relevancy. As an avid music listener and fan myself, I have been intrigued by this curse and have always questioned its validity. Do the successes of artists truly decrease after winning this award? Is there a way to predict the success trajectory of future Best New Artist winners?</p>
<p>To answer these questions I will be utilizing my data science knowledge and skills to analyze the post-award musical achievements of these artists and explore the potential for predicting an artist’s success. Without further ado, follow me as I combine music and data to dissect the mysteries of the Best New Artist curse.</p>
<section id="data-collection" class="level1">
<h1>Data Collection</h1>
<p>Every Data Science project needs its data, therefore I went ahead and collected as much data as I could find publicly to investigate this curse. I went through a meticulous data collection process utilizing various methods:</p>
<section id="manual-data-entry" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="manual-data-entry">Manual Data Entry</h2>
<p>Beginning with the focal point of the project, I used the Grammy’s official website to compile a list of Best New Artist winners spanning from 1980 to 2022 <span class="citation" data-cites="grammys_info">(<a href="#ref-grammys_info" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Awards Nominations &amp; Winners”</span> 1980-2022</a>)</span>. To assess post-award activity, I used the IMDb.com website to collect information about music award wins and nominations from the MTV Video Music Awards <span class="citation" data-cites="vmas_info">(<a href="#ref-vmas_info" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“MTV Video Music Awards (VMA)”</span> 1985-2022</a>)</span> and the American Music Awards <span class="citation" data-cites="amas_info">(<a href="#ref-amas_info" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“American Music Awards”</span> 1985-2022</a>)</span>, as well as the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) website to gather data regarding gold, platinum, and diamond awards <span class="citation" data-cites="riaa_info">(<a href="#ref-riaa_info" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Gold &amp; Platinum,”</span> n.d.</a>)</span>. For all of these manual collections, I entered the data into a separate spreadsheet for each unique award.</p>
<p>I also manually collect details about the winners, including birth location, gender, and membership in music groups, primarily from Wikipedia <span class="citation" data-cites="wikipedia">(<a href="#ref-wikipedia" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Wikipedia,”</span> n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="web-scraping" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="web-scraping">Web Scraping</h2>
<p>To further investigate post-award activity, I employed web-scraping techniques<span class="citation" data-cites="web_scraping_help">Breuss (<a href="#ref-web_scraping_help2" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span> to collect Billboard Hot 100s data <span class="citation" data-cites="billbord_chart">(<a href="#ref-billbord_chart" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Billboard Hot 100”</span> 1985-2022</a>)</span>. Collecting this data will allow us to look for how many chart appearances these award recipients have had post-award win.</p>
</section>
<section id="spotify-api" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spotify-api">Spotify API</h2>
<p>Utilizing Spotify’s API, I collected data on the genres associated with each Best New Artist winner <span class="citation" data-cites="spotify_api">(<a href="#ref-spotify_api" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Build with Spotify’s 100 Million Songs,”</span> n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>These methods allowed me to collect a wide variety of data that can be used for future analysis. Please keep in mind that there are potential limitations that arise from this collected data, particularly in regards to the reliability of the data collected from public sources.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="data-cleaning" class="level1">
<h1>Data Cleaning</h1>
<p>With any data driven project, data preprocessing is a crucial step in creating your models and visualizations. For this project I went through each dataset and performed the usual preprocessing techniques which included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Changing data types: I had to adjust any date column on my datasets to be a date/time object rather than a categorical object</p></li>
<li><p>Checking for Missing and Duplicate Values: Luckily, since I mainly collected the data manually and had full control over what data I was grabbing, I had no missing or duplicated values to worry about!</p></li>
<li><p>Dropping unnecessary columns: After collecting the data, I had time between collecting it and creating my code to really think about the practicality some columns had towards my overall project. Therefore some columns were dropped during this stage.</p></li>
<li><p>Removing white spaces, brackets, changing casing: Very typical grammar fixes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now aside from the simple techniques, I did have to do a little more thinking and perform some complicated procedures. First and foremost, many songs that are featured on the charts or nominated for an award may have either more than one mian artist or more than one featured artist on the song. Since my project is focusing on the post-award win activity of each of the winners, I want to ensure I include every instance an artist is seen on a chart or award nomination, even if that means they are not the only artist on that song. Therefore, I had to split the artist columns on the Billboard Hot 100s, VMA, and AMA datasets in order to have each artist on a song be represented by their own column. After separating each of the main and featured artists, I went ahead and filtered the dataset to only include the instances where the Best New Artists winners were spotted and reduced to have two binary columns that verify whether the artist is a main artist or featured artist for this instance. The VMA and AMA dataset also had a column that included whether they won the award or not.</p>
<p>The RIAA dataset also had me perform some extra steps to get it cleaned up. Aside from adjusting and combing the separated date columns, I also went ahead and renamed some of the award names. Any platinum or diamond award that has a value such as “2x, 3x, 4x, etc” in front of it was renamed to simply “multi-platinum” or “multi-diamond”. I did this so that it will be easier to visualize and understand. Furthermore, I created dummy variables for each of the awards types.</p>
<p>Lastly the Artist Genre dataset also had some extra steps to take care of during this stage. It should be well known that which the fast growth of music throughout the years, there has been an expansion of genres artists sing. In fact, many artists may be associated with more than one genre. Due to this, for each artist the Spotify API gave me a list of genres associated with this artist. Now while it is important for artists to be labeled by their respective genre, in this project the subgenres are a little too specific. Therefore, the EDA section of my project will utilize the list of genres for each artist while the modeling part of the project I made the decision to generalize the sub genres they are associated with to the main genre they fall under. After adjusting their associated genre, I performed one-hot encoding to split each genre into a separate column in preparation for future modeling.</p>

Figure&nbsp;2: Distribution of the Best New Artist winners in Music Groups.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>According to the <a href="#fig-gender_distribution" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, it is evident that female artists dominate the Grammys’ Best New Artist award, followed by male artists. The “both” catergory represents bands that includes memebrs of both genders. Similarly, <a href="#fig-group_distribution" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> tells us that solo artists tend to win these awards over music groups.</p>
<p>While this observation does not relate to my initial research question, it is interesting to note the patterns in who these winners tend to be.</p>

Figure&nbsp;3: Common genres associated with the Best New Artist winners

<p>Next up, since each artist is associated with several different genres, I want to visualize the most common genres that are shared by these Best New Artist winners. While this information is not directly appicable to my research question, it is interesting to see what genres tend to dominant the Best New Artist award. Based on <a href="#fig-word_cloud" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>, we can see that some of the most popular genres include: dance pop, pop, urban contemporary, new wave pop, and rhythm and blues (R&amp;B).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="artist-activity-throughout-the-years">Artist Activity Throughout the Years</h2>
<p>In order to really investigate whether the success of an artist decreases after winning the Best New Artist award. I created two x-axis interactive timeline charts, one chart visualizes when each artist appeared on the Billboard Hot100s chart and the other chart visualizes when each artist won/were nominated for an award.</p>
<p>These timelines will allow us to view how active and relevant each artist was after winning their Best New Artist Award.</p>

Figure&nbsp;5: Timeline of Best New Artist wins and Billboard Hot 100s entries.
</figcaption>

</div>
<p>Both timelines yield very similar conclusions that challenged the speculation that winning the Best New Artist award leads to an unsuccessful or inactive careers. <a href="#fig-vma_ama" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a> displays the award and nomination activity for each artist along with the date they won the Best New Artist Award, which offers us insights inot their post-Grammy recognition. Reviewing both wins and nominations allows us to figure out if these artists continue to be celebrated for their music. While some artists indeed fade away from prominence after their Grammy win (such as Jody Watley, Esperanza Spalding, Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis), others contine to receive acclaim (such as Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys, Carrie Underwood, Maroon 5).</p>
<p><a href="#fig-hot100s_timeline" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a> is my personal favorite. From the data I collected, in my opinion the Billboard Hot 100s data is a very good and reliable indicator of how well an artist is doing in the music industry. This chart is a very respectable chart that many artists yearn to appear on <span class="citation" data-cites="chart_important">(<a href="#ref-chart_important" role="doc-biblioref">Patrick, n.d.</a>)</span>. Being on this chart means that an artist’s song is very popular during the week, taking into account its sales, streams, radio play, and online downloads.</p>
<p>This timeline shows us that a lot of artists had very long and successful careers post-award win. For example Mariah Carey can be seen to have a very long and consistent career after being named the Best New Artist in 1991. This timeline shows us that not every artist’s career deteriorated after winning the Best New Artist Award. Many artists are either still relevant today, as they are still being seen on the charts, or have generally had a long career, such as Toni Braxton and Christina Aguilera. While there are artists who did suffer landing on the charts post win, this may not be the work of the Best New Artist curse, rather it may just be due to coincidence or more personal reasons. This timeline helps prove that this curse is simply just a myth, and that not all of the artists who win the award suffer career decline.</p>

<h1>Predicting Success</h1>
<p>Despite the limitations of a fairly small dataset, I want to attempt to make a model that can predict the success of an artist after winning the Best New Artist Award. Now, you might be wondering, how exactly am I going to predict the success of an artist? Well the answer lies in creating my own unique success metric.</p>
<section id="quantifying-success" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quantifying-success">Quantifying Success</h2>
<p>For this project, I decided to base the success of the artist based on these four factors: the number of Billboard Charted songs, RIAA awards, AMAS/VMAS awards and nominations.</p>
<p>In order to take into consideration the fact that older artists may have more activity compared to newer winners, I will only be focusing on each artist’s accomplishments within the five years after they won the Best New Artist award. So in this case the artists from 2019 and on will not be included.</p>
<p>Here is how I will be scoring the artists:</p>
<p>Billboard single: If chart position is</p>
<ul>
<li>1 - 20: 5 points per song</li>
<li>21 - 40: 4 points per song</li>
<li>41 - 60: 3 points per song</li>
<li>61 - 80: 2 points per song</li>
<li>81 - 100: 1 point per song</li>
<li>featured artist: 1 point per song</li>
</ul>
<p>RIAA Awards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Diamond: 5 points</li>
<li>Diamond: 4 points</li>
<li>Multi-Platinum: 3 points</li>
<li>Platinum: 2 points</li>
<li>Gold: 1 points</li>
</ul>
<p>American Music Awards/MTV Video Music Awards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Win: 5 points</li>
<li>Nomination: 2 points</li>
</ul>
<p>After calculating the scores for each artist based on each feature, I noticed that some features had a much wider range of values than the others. To make sure all features contributed equally to the final score, I used a method called min-max normalization. This technique scales all scores to fit within the same range. Once the scores were normalized, I added them together to calculate each artist’s total success score.</p>
<p>To predict the scores I tested three regression models. After combining the necessary information, I checked for multicollinearity between the predictors I will be using: music genres, artist gender, and membership in music groups. Multicollinearity occurs when predictors are very correlated with each other, which can affect the reliability of a model’s predictions. I found that there was high multicollinearity throughout the dataset, especially between the gender and music group features. However, due to the limited amount of predictors and observations being used, I will be keeping all of the predictors for the modeling portion of this project. Therefore please be aware that the model’s coefficients may not be reliably interpretable.</p>
<p>I will create and compare the following regression models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Decision Tree Regressor.</p>

Tip: Mean Squared What?
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Here is a quick lesson on the metrics to evaluate a regression model.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mean squared error (MSE): This metric finds the difference between the actual/true values of data points and the predicted values. The lower the MSE score, the better the model’s performance is.</p></li>
<li><p>Mean Average Error (MAE): This metric calculates the average of all of the differences between the actual/true values and the predicted values. Similar to the MSE metric, the lower the score, the better the model’s performance is.</p></li>
<li><p>R squared: This metric describes the proportion of variance in the model and how strong the relationship is between the independent and the dependent variables. For this metric, a higher score indicates better model performance.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>After evaluating the performance of each regression model, it is safe to say that the Decision Tree Regressor model outperforms the others. This conclusion is supported by its relatively low Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values, suggesting a better predictive accuracy compared to the other models. Furthermore, the Decision Tree Regressor has the highest R-squared value, indicating that it explains a greater proportion of the variance in the target variable.</p>
<p>However, it is important to recognize that while this model demonstrates the best performance among the models tested, its performance is not that exceptional. This is most likely due to the limited size and simplicity of the data, which provides a constrained number of observations and features. It is reasonable to infer that more data would further strengthen the model’s predictive capabilities.</p>

</section>
<section id="limitations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The biggest limiation I faced while working on this project was lack of data. Not only was I working with a small set of artists, but I was very limited to what data I can collect for these artists. Some information I wanted to, but could not, collect are: number of concerts/tours each artist performed, and mentions in social media.</p>
<p>Furthermore, success is not only about the numbers and the amount of awards and recognition an artist recieves throughout the years. My project lacks the ability to take into action the more impactful ways artist’s have made their marks on the music industry. Success is a very subjective topic, so at the end of the day, an artist may be seen as more successful and impactful than others by certain people.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that some celebrities dissappear from the music industry due to personal factors, such as: retirement, scandals, death, etc..</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This project was very enjoyable to work on as it allowed me to mix my own personal passions and curiousities with my knowledge in Data Science. I believe this curse is simply a myth, it does not exist. Based on the visuals presented in this project, there are many artists who continue to grow their careers after winning the Best New Artist Award.</p>
<p>In the future, I would love to expand on my findings and dive deeper into the reason why certain artists become more successful than others. To add more observations, I would like to compare the success of the Grammy Best New Artist’s to equivalent Best New Artist award’s in other music award shows. Furthermore, I am looking to also utilize my models to create a program that will allow one to input features an artist possesses in order to predict their success score.</p>

This is a very challenging task but here is a hint: they have all won a similar music award. If your answer is that they all won a Grammy, you are partially correct. These five artists are all recipients of the Grammy’s Best New Artist Award. </span>
<span id="cb6-26"><a href="#cb6-26" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-27"><a href="#cb6-27" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Presented by the Recording Academy of the United States, the Grammy Awards show is one of the most prestigious award shows in the music industry. With over 90 awards recognizing the successes and talents of many individuals within the music industry, the Best New Artist award presented during the show draws a lot of attention due to the fact that it shines light towards talented new artists.</span>
<span id="cb6-28"><a href="#cb6-28" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-29"><a href="#cb6-29" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Aside from the excitement associated with this ceremony and the awards given out, there is a dark mystery that is tied to the Grammys: the Best New Artist Curse. The curse has been a subject of debate for years <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@curse_article</span><span class="co">]</span>, stating that winners of this award are cursed with a short-lived career, marked by a decline in successes, achievements, and relevancy. As an avid music listener and fan myself, I have been intrigued by this curse and have always questioned its validity. Do the successes of artists truly decrease after winning this award? Is there a way to predict the success trajectory of future Best New Artist winners? </span>
<span id="cb6-30"><a href="#cb6-30" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-31"><a href="#cb6-31" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>To answer these questions I will be utilizing my data science knowledge and skills to analyze the post-award musical achievements of these artists and explore the potential for predicting an artist’s success. Without further ado, follow me as I combine music and data to dissect the mysteries of the Best New Artist curse. </span>

<span id="cb6-63"><a href="#cb6-63" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Every Data Science project needs its data, therefore I went ahead and collected as much data as I could find publicly to investigate this curse. I went through a meticulous data collection process utilizing various methods:</span>
<span id="cb6-64"><a href="#cb6-64" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-65"><a href="#cb6-65" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">## Manual Data Entry</span></span>
<span id="cb6-66"><a href="#cb6-66" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Beginning with the focal point of the project, I used the Grammy’s official website to compile a list of Best New Artist winners spanning from 1980 to 2022 <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@grammys_info</span><span class="co">]</span>. To assess post-award activity, I used the IMDb.com website to collect information about music award wins and nominations from the MTV Video Music Awards <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@vmas_info</span><span class="co">]</span> and the American Music Awards <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@amas_info</span><span class="co">]</span>, as well as the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) website to gather data regarding gold, platinum, and diamond awards <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@riaa_info</span><span class="co">]</span>. For all of these manual collections, I entered the data into a separate spreadsheet for each unique award. </span>
<span id="cb6-67"><a href="#cb6-67" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-68"><a href="#cb6-68" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I also manually collect details about the winners, including birth location, gender, and membership in music groups, primarily from Wikipedia <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@wikipedia</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>

<span id="cb6-71"><a href="#cb6-71" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>To further investigate post-award activity, I employed web-scraping techniques<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@web_scraping_help, @web_scraping_help2</span><span class="co">]</span> to collect Billboard Hot 100s data <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@billbord_chart</span><span class="co">]</span>. Collecting this data will allow us to look for how many chart appearances these award recipients have had post-award win. </span>

<span id="cb6-73"><a href="#cb6-73" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">## Spotify API</span></span>
<span id="cb6-74"><a href="#cb6-74" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Utilizing Spotify’s API, I collected data on the genres associated with each Best New Artist winner <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@spotify_api</span><span class="co">]</span>. </span>

<span id="cb6-822"><a href="#cb6-822" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>With any data driven project, data preprocessing is a crucial step in creating your models and visualizations.

Therefore some columns were dropped during this stage.</span>

<span id="cb6-832"><a href="#cb6-832" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Now aside from the simple techniques, I did have to do a little more thinking and perform some complicated procedures. First and foremost, many songs that are featured on the charts or nominated for an award may have either more than one mian artist or more than one featured artist on the song. Since my project is focusing on the post-award win activity of each of the winners, I want to ensure I include every instance an artist is seen on a chart or award nomination, even if that means they are not the only artist on that song. Therefore, I had to split the artist columns on the Billboard Hot 100s, VMA, and AMA datasets in order to have each artist on a song be represented by their own column. After separating each of the main and featured artists, I went ahead and filtered the dataset to only include the instances where the Best New Artists winners were spotted and reduced to have two binary columns that verify whether the artist is a main artist or featured artist for this instance. The VMA and AMA dataset also had a column that included whether they won the award or not. </span>

<span id="cb6-834"><a href="#cb6-834" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The RIAA dataset also had me perform some extra steps to get it cleaned up. Aside from adjusting and combing the separated date columns, I also went ahead and renamed some of the award names. Any platinum or diamond award that has a value such as “2x, 3x, 4x, etc” in front of it was renamed to simply “multi-platinum” or “multi-diamond”. I did this so that it will be easier to visualize and understand. Furthermore, I created dummy variables for each of the awards types. </span>
<span id="cb6-835"><a href="#cb6-835" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-836"><a href="#cb6-836" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Lastly the Artist Genre dataset also had some extra steps to take care of during this stage. It should be well known that which the fast growth of music throughout the years, there has been an expansion of genres artists sing. In fact, many artists may be associated with more than one  genre. Due to this, for each artist the Spotify API gave me a list of genres associated with this artist. Now while it is important for artists to be labeled by their respective genre, in this project the subgenres are a little too specific. Therefore, the EDA section of my project will utilize the list of genres for each artist while the modeling part of the project I made the decision to generalize the sub genres they are associated with to the main genre they fall under. After adjusting their associated genre, I performed one-hot encoding to split each genre into a separate column in preparation for future modeling. </span>

While this information is not directly appicable to my research question, it is interesting to see what genres tend to dominant the Best New Artist award. Based on @fig-word_cloud, we can see that some of the most popular genres include: dance pop, pop, urban contemporary, new wave pop, and rhythm and blues (R&amp;B). </span>

<span id="cb6-1183"><a href="#cb6-1183" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Both timelines yield very similar conclusions that challenged the speculation that winning the Best New Artist award leads to an unsuccessful or inactive careers. @fig-vma_ama displays the award and nomination activity for each artist along with the date they won the Best New Artist Award, which offers us insights inot their post-Grammy recognition. Reviewing both wins and nominations allows us to figure out if these artists continue to be celebrated for their music. While some artists indeed fade away from prominence after their Grammy win (such as Jody Watley, Esperanza Spalding, Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis), others contine to receive acclaim (such as Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys, Carrie Underwood, Maroon 5). </span>

<span id="cb6-1185"><a href="#cb6-1185" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>@fig-hot100s_timeline is my personal favorite. From the data I collected, in my opinion the Billboard Hot 100s data is a very good and reliable indicator of how well an artist is doing in the music industry. This chart is a very respectable chart that many artists yearn to appear on <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@chart_important</span><span class="co">]</span>. Being on this chart means that an artist's song is very popular during the week, taking into account its sales, streams, radio play, and online downloads. </span>

<span id="cb6-1187"><a href="#cb6-1187" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This timeline shows us that a lot of artists had very long and successful careers post-award win. For example Mariah Carey can be seen to have a very long and consistent career after being named the Best New Artist in 1991. This timeline shows us that not every artist’s career deteriorated after winning the Best New Artist Award. Many artists are either still relevant today, as they are still being seen on the charts, or have generally had a long career, such as Toni Braxton and Christina Aguilera. While there are artists who did suffer landing on the charts post win, this may not be the work of the Best New Artist curse, rather it may just be due to coincidence or more personal reasons. This timeline helps prove that this curse is simply just a myth, and that not all of the artists who win the award suffer career decline. </span>

Now, you might be wondering, how exactly am I going to predict the success of an artist? Well the answer lies in creating my own unique success metric.</span>

To make sure all features contributed equally to the final score, I used a method called min-max normalization. This technique scales all scores to fit within the same range. Once the scores were normalized, I added them together to calculate each artist’s total success score. </span>

<span id="cb6-1767"><a href="#cb6-1767" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>To predict the scores I tested three regression models. After combining the necessary information, I checked for multicollinearity between the predictors I will be using: music genres, artist gender, and membership in music groups. Multicollinearity occurs when predictors are very correlated with each other, which can affect the reliability of a model’s predictions. I found that there was high multicollinearity throughout the dataset, especially between the gender and music group features. However, due to the limited amount of predictors and observations being used, I will be keeping all of the predictors for the modeling portion of this project. Therefore please be aware that the model's coefficients may not be reliably interpretable.</span>

<span id="cb6-1908"><a href="#cb6-1908" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Here is a quick lesson on the metrics to evaluate a regression model. </span>
<span id="cb6-1909"><a href="#cb6-1909" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-1910"><a href="#cb6-1910" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">- </span>Mean squared error (MSE): This metric finds the difference between the actual/true values of data points and the predicted values. The lower the MSE score, the better the model's performance is.   </span>
<span id="cb6-1911"><a href="#cb6-1911" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-1912"><a href="#cb6-1912" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">- </span>Mean Average Error (MAE): This metric calculates the average of all of the differences between the actual/true values and the predicted values. Similar to the MSE metric, the lower the score, the better the model's performance is. </span>
<span id="cb6-1913"><a href="#cb6-1913" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-1914"><a href="#cb6-1914" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">- </span>R squared: This metric describes the proportion of variance in the model and how strong the relationship is between the independent and the dependent variables. For this metric, a higher score indicates better model performance. </span>
<span id="cb6-1915"><a href="#cb6-1915" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>:::</span>

<span id="cb6-1917"><a href="#cb6-1917" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>After evaluating the performance of each regression model, it is safe to say that the Decision Tree Regressor model outperforms the others. This conclusion is supported by its relatively low Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values, suggesting a better predictive accuracy compared to the other models. Furthermore, the Decision Tree Regressor has the highest R-squared value, indicating that it explains a greater proportion of the variance in the target variable. </span>
<span id="cb6-1918"><a href="#cb6-1918" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-1919"><a href="#cb6-1919" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>However, it is important to recognize that while this model demonstrates the best performance among the models tested, its performance is not that exceptional. This is most likely due to the limited size and simplicity of the data, which provides a constrained number of observations and features. It is reasonable to infer that more data would further strengthen the model's predictive capabilities.</span>

<span id="cb6-1948"><a href="#cb6-1948" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The biggest limiation I faced while working on this project was lack of data. Not only was I working with a small set of artists, but I was very limited to what data I can collect for these artists. Some information I wanted to, but could not, collect are: number of concerts/tours each artist performed, and mentions in social media. </span>
<span id="cb6-1949"><a href="#cb6-1949" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-1950"><a href="#cb6-1950" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Furthermore, success is not only about the numbers and the amount of awards and recognition an artist recieves throughout the years. My project lacks the ability to take into action the more impactful ways artist's have made their marks on the music industry. Success is a very subjective topic, so at the end of the day, an artist may be seen as more successful and impactful than others by certain people. </span>

<span id="cb6-1952"><a href="#cb6-1952" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>It is also worth noting that some celebrities dissappear from the music industry due to personal factors, such as: retirement, scandals, death, etc..</span>

<span id="cb6-1956"><a href="#cb6-1956" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This project was very enjoyable to work on as it allowed me to mix my own personal passions and curiousities with my knowledge in Data Science. I believe this curse is simply a myth, it does not exist. Based on the visuals presented in this project, there are many artists who continue to grow their careers after winning the Best New Artist Award.</span>
<span id="cb6-1957"><a href="#cb6-1957" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-1958"><a href="#cb6-1958" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In the future, I would love to expand on my findings and dive deeper into the reason why certain artists become more successful than others. To add more observations, I would like to compare the success of the Grammy Best New Artist's to equivalent Best New Artist award's in other music award shows. Furthermore, I am looking to also utilize my models to create a program that will allow one to input features an artist possesses in order to predict their success score.</span>
